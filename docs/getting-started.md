# Getting Started

This section outlines how to go from nothing to having a Snoozle-based REST API up and running.

This section assumes the following:

- A (very) basic knowledge of C# and Visual Studio
- A compatible version of .NET installed (download the SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- Visual Studio installed (download the Community Edition for free [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/))
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (or equivalent) for testing the endpoints

### Choose your data provider

Snoozle provides an extensible set of base classes and interfaces that can be used to enable data persistence using a variety of technologies. The basic Snoozle package provides in-memory persistence, which is what this demo will use.

See the [data providers](data-providers.md) page for a full list.

### Create a new web project in Visual Studio

### Add Snoozle to Startup.cs

### Create a REST resource

### Create a resource configuration

### Run the application and test with Postman
