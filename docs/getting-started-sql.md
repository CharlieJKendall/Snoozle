# Getting Started

This section outlines how to go from nothing to having a Snoozle-based REST API up and running.

!!! info "Prerequisites"
    This section will assume the following:
    - A (very) basic knowledge of C# and Visual Studio
    - A compatible version of .NET installed
    - Visual Studio installed (download the Community Edition for free [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/))

# Choose your data provider

Snoozle provides an extensible set of base classes and interfaces that can be used to enable data persistence using a variety of technologies. The basic Snoozle package provides in-memory persistence, which is what this demo will use.

See the [data providers](data-providers.md) page for a full list.
